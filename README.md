# Axial Tilt
A mod for the game Factorio, adding seasonal changes to the length of the day.

The base game has the day split into 50% daytime, 40% dawn/dusk, 10% night.
The default settings for this mod alter that on a 30-day cycle, with the shortest
daytime being 20% and the longest 70%. Winter has long nights and summer has dusk
transitioning to dawn with no full darkness at all.

Also exposes an option to make game days longer or shorter.
